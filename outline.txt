DO NOT TREAT THIS AS DOCUMENTATION. this is basically a scratchpad for notes and will most likely diverge from the code after a while

parse options
	if argv[1] == '-h':
		print help text
		exit
	else:

argv[1]
cache size -> atoi

argv[2]	
associativity ( direct / assoc / assoc:n) -> check and set some flags or something, parse assoc:n

argv[3]
block size -> atoi
	
argv[4]
write policy -> check wt or wb, set flag

argv[5]
trace file -> open,read


create cache from options
	???
	we have the cache itself
	sets in cache 
	cache lines in set
	and then cache lines have valid bits, tag, actual data


open file
parse line by line?
sscanf

read memory:
	parse set index
	parse tag
	get cache_set from cache
	look for tag in cache_set
	if there, cache hit
	if not, cache miss
		memory read
		if there is a cache line with valid bit == 0
			set that valid bit = 1
		else:
			find lru line
			if writeback and line is dirty
				memory write
				set dirty bit to clean
		update tag


	update lru counter w/ pc?
